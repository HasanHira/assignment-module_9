In this report, I will be discussing the design and implementation of my personal blog using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The blog consists of four pages: homepage, blog page, single post page, and contact page. I hav faced challenges during the design process, but with research and practice, I have done the job.

The blog consists of five pages like homepage, blog page, single post page, contact page and also a welcome page. The homepage includes a featured post section and a navigation menu with links to the other pages on the website. The blog page lists the blog posts with a "Read More" button to view the full post, and the single post page displays the full blog post and includes social sharing buttons. The contact page includes a form that sends an email to the blog owner when submitted. The website is responsive and looks good on all devices.
